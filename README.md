# State-Finance-Polarization-Code
Code to analyze the relationship between deficits, debt obligations, and legislative polarization

This code analyzes how the relationship between general deficit per capita, debt obligations per capita, and legislative polarization varies by the stringency of a state's balanced budget framework. Standard errors are clustered by state.  I also produces marginal effects plots to illustrate the relationship.
